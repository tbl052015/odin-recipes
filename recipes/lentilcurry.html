    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Here’s why you’ll love this Vegan Red Lentil Curry Weeknight ready: It’s
      ready in 35-45 minutes so you can easily make it for a weeknight dinner.
      Creamy and dreamy: This curry is extremely creamy and indulgent. You can
      thank the full-fat coconut milk and the creamy almond butter for that.
      Flavorful beyond belief: It’s packed with flavor thanks to the fresh
      garlic, ginger, and chili peppers, along with a generous dose of Indian
      spices. Nourishing: This red lentil curry might be dangerously delicious
      and indulgent, but it’s also quite nourishing. The garlic, ginger, and
      turmeric boast tons of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, while
      the lentils make this a hearty, protein-packed meal. Plus, you’ll stay
      full for hours due to the high content of healthy fat from coconut milk
      and almond butter.

      Ingredient Rundown Aromatics. This curry starts with fresh ginger, garlic,
      and green chili peppers to provide lots of those classic Indian flavors.
      My mom starts most Indian dishes with these ingredients (sometimes, onions
      too), so you can’t go wrong with this trio! Turmeric. Most Indian lentil
      curry recipes contain turmeric. And why not? It’s a nutritional superstar
      with anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. The main active in
      turmeric—curcumin—not only blocks damage-causing free radicals in the body
      but also stimulates the body’s own antioxidant mechanisms. I love using
      fresh turmeric in this recipe. It’s earthy and peppery, slightly bitter
      yet slightly sweet. It looks like ginger but its interior flesh is bright
      orange. You can find fresh turmeric at Indian and Asian grocery stores,
      health food stores, and the produce department of stores like Whole Foods
      and Sprouts. That said, it’s totally fine to use ground turmeric in this
      recipe! I’ve made it both ways, and it’s always delicious. Ground Indian
      Spices. While I love adding some whole spices to my Indian recipes, I
      wanted to keep this recipe weeknight friendly and very accessible. You’ll
      add the spices after sautéing the aromatics, and they need just 30 to 60
      seconds to toast. Red Lentils. The main ingredient in this recipe are red
      lentils, no surprise! You can use regular red lentils, or red split
      lentils. The split variety is more commonly available in South Asian
      grocery stores, and sold as masoor dal. The split lentils cook a bit
      quicker than the whole variety because their skins have been removed, but
      there isn’t a huge difference in cook time. Need another use for those red
      lentils in your pantry? My 10-Ingredient Red Lentil Bolognese is a
      must-make (and pantry-friendly!). Crushed Tomatoes. I prefer to use
      crushed canned tomatoes (instead of diced tomatoes or fresh tomatoes)
      because I love their thick, saucy texture in a creamy curry. Coconut Milk.
      I use full-fat canned coconut milk in this recipe, and I must say it’s an
      essential ingredient. The creaminess and high-fat content not only makes
      this curry extremely luxurious, but they are also necessary to balance the
      spice and tanginess in this curry. If you taste the curry before adding
      the coconut milk, you’ll notice it is quite acidic (from the tomatoes) and
      very spicy, almost too spicy to eat. But after the coconut milk cooks down
      for a few minutes, it transforms into a totally different dish. Almond
      Butter. This is my secret ingredient! Almond butter is definitely not
      traditional in Indian curries, but many North Indian curries do rely on
      blended cashews to bring creaminess…so it’s not that different, right? The
      almond butter brings another level of richness to this curry, in addition
      to a subtly sweet nuttiness that is just lovely. Lemon Juice and Cilantro.
      My mom finishes many of her Indian dishes with these ingredients—the lemon
      juice adds a pop of freshness and livens the flavors, as well as helps
      balance the spices, while the cilantro adds flavor—so I usually finish my
      curries this way too.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon refined or virgin coconut oil, or a neutral-flavored oil
      </li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and minced or grated</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh turmeric, or 1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1-2 serrano peppers, diced (see recipe note below on spice level)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>
        1/2 teaspoon Indian red chili powder (if you only have regular chili
        powder, which is a blend, use 1 teaspoon)
      </li>
      <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>
        Kosher salt or sea salt to taste (I use about 1 tsp kosher salt, and add
        more at the end)
      </li>
      <li>Freshly cracked black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>
        1 cup (180-190g) red lentils, or split red lentils (the split variety
        will cook a bit quicker)
      </li>
      <li>2 cups (480 mL) low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
      <li>
        1 (14-ounce / 400g) can crushed tomatoes (or half of a 28-ounce can)
      </li>
      <li>1 (13.5-ounce/400 mL) can full-fat coconut milk</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened creamy almond butter</li>
      <li>1/2 a small lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (~8g) fresh cilantro, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>
        For serving: Basmati or Jasmine rice and Indian flatbread such as roti,
        paratha, or naan
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps/Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Rinse the lentils in cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
      <li>
        Heat a large, deep skillet or large saucepan over medium-high heat and
        add the coconut oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add the garlic, ginger,
        fresh turmeric (if using), and Serrano pepper and cook for 2 minutes,
        stirring frequently to prevent garlic from burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cumin, coriander, chili powder, curry powder, garam masala,
        salt, and black pepper to taste, and cook for 30 to 60 seconds until
        fragrant, tossing frequently to prevent burning. If using ground
        turmeric instead of fresh turmeric, add the ground turmeric now, along
        the the rest of the spices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the vegetable broth, and use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape
        up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot. Add in the lentils and the
        crushed tomatoes and mix well. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan
        with a lid. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked
        through and have mostly softened. If you find that the lentils are not
        quite soft after 25 minutes, add a few spoons more of broth or water and
        cook for another 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the lid and stir in the coconut milk, almond butter, along with
        salt and pepper to taste Continue cooking on low heat, uncovered for 5
        to 8 minutes, until the curry has thickened and is creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, stir in the lemon juice and cilantro, and turn off the heat. If
        you want your lentils to even creamier and more on the puréed side, use
        an immersion blender to lightly purée the curry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the curry with rice and/or Indian flatbread and garnish with
        additional cilantro. Store leftovers in the fridge for 3-4 days.
